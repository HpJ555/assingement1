    <p>"Don Quixote," widely considered the first modern novel, follows the adventures of Alonso Quixano, a middle-aged gentleman who, inspired by chivalric romances, transforms into the knight-errant Don Quixote. Accompanied by his faithful squire Sancho Panza, he embarks on a series of misadventures, tilting at windmills and misinterpreting the world around him as a fantastical realm, all while grappling with his own sanity and the changing nature of reality. </p>
